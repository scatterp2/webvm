# AI Agent Handoff / Operating Notes

> Keep this section current when changing the reset mechanism or Qwen experiment. These notes are intended to let an AI agent continue the work without asking the user to repeat repository context.

## Current objective: prove Kaggle API-mediated notebook I/O

The active task is a small, harmless controller↔Kaggle notebook RX/TX proof. The notebook has internet disabled by design, so it must not rely on notebook-side DNS or outbound HTTP. The controller publishes an RX Dataset resource, submits a self-contained notebook that reads the mounted input and writes a TX response file, then downloads and validates that output.

Relevant files:
- `examples/python3/kaggle_io_loop/controller.py` — controller-side Dataset create/version, notebook submission, status polling, output retrieval, checksum validation and JSONL request/result logging.
- `examples/python3/kaggle_io_loop/agent.py` — self-contained notebook agent; validates the fixed input message and writes one acknowledgement output.
- `examples/python3/kaggle_io_loop/README.md` — setup, protocol and documented API references.
- `.github/workflows/validate-kaggle-runner.yml` — syntax checks plus offline protocol proof, requiring no Kaggle credentials or network.
- `examples/python3/pi_impl.py` — bootstraps the IO-loop controller from the current main branch and launches the proof when the WebVM reset runs.

Stage 1 proves one published input → mounted notebook input → downloaded output file. It does not yet prove that a running notebook sees a later Dataset version without restart. Treat mounted inputs as a per-run snapshot unless the live-update test demonstrates otherwise. The stream/proxy layer is explicitly out of scope.

The Qwen weight-space interpretation experiment remains in `examples/python3/kaggle_runtime.py` and its prior submission path, but is not the active task until the IO loop is proven.

## How the WebVM reset is triggered and verified

The reset source of truth is the plain-text `reset` file on **`main`**. Put a new generation number in that file and commit it. The deployed page in `src/app.html` fetches that raw GitHub file with cache-busting every **15 seconds**, and also checks on page startup and `pageshow`. A new generation is added to the URL as `?reset=<generation>` and dispatched as a reset event; the WebVM handler clears the disk cache and reloads.

Do not treat the “already handled” log as proof that the disk cache was reset. Verify the complete sequence in the browser console: new generation detected, reset begins, reset completes and reloads, and the URL includes the new generation after reload. If reset fails, the generation marker must be cleared so the next poll can retry.

## How to inspect runtime logs and failure evidence

The current IO-loop controller writes `/home/user/kaggle-io-loop-run/run.jsonl`. Inspect its `API_REQUEST_START`, `API_REQUEST_RESULT`, `EXECUTION_STATUS`, `OUTPUT_VALIDATION` and `LOOP_PROOF_PASS` records. The notebook writes its agent events to Kaggle execution logs and returns `tx_response.json`. Do not infer a successful loop from a successful GitHub Actions syntax test: the live Kaggle run must return a matching, checksum-valid response.

The earlier Qwen run had separate failures involving Kaggle API TLS upload errors and DNS/network access from inside Kaggle. This IO-loop proof deliberately avoids requiring notebook internet, so no DNS result is expected from the notebook. Controller-side Kaggle API calls still require working controller network access and Kaggle credentials.

**Agent workflow:** inspect the newest logs; find the earliest concrete failure; make a focused fix; commit; wait for validation; then inspect the actual Kaggle execution result. Do not ask the user to retrieve logs that repository tooling can fetch itself.

# Browser Compute Project

A WebVM-based browser compute environment with WebGPU virtual compute capabilities.

## Overview

This [project](https://scatterp2.github.io/webvm/) extends [WebVM](https://webvm.io) — a serverless Linux virtual machine running in your browser via WebAssembly — with additional compute capabilities and automation tooling.

## Documentation

### Core Documentation
- **[WebVM Guide](README-webvm.md)** - Complete documentation for WebVM including setup, networking, deployment, and Claude AI integration
- **[WebGPU Compute Layer](README-addgpu.md)** - Technical specification for browser-native GPU compute using WebGPU, WebAssembly SIMD, and virtual compute interfaces

### Key Features

#### WebVM Base
- Full Linux environment running client-side in HTML5/WebAssembly
- Powered by CheerpX virtualization engine (x86-to-WebAssembly JIT)
- Tailscale networking support for private network access
- Debian distribution with native development toolchains

#### Extended Capabilities
- **Playwright Integration**: Node.js-based browser automation stack
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive Python environment
- **WebGPU Compute**: Virtual compute layer compiling workloads to WebGPU pipelines (see `README-addgpu.md`)
